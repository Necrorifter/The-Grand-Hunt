Shamans are spiritual guides and practitioners, not of the divine, but of the very elements. Unlike some other mystics, shamans commune with forces that are not strictly benevolent. The elements are chaotic, and left to their own devices, they rage against one another in unending primal fury. It is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos. Acting as moderators among earth, fire, water, and air, shamans summon totems that focus the elements to support the shamanâ€™s allies or punish those who threaten them.

/*Using initiative stat or something similar to avoid events.

I am working on merging player stats with combat events and by extension, the regular encounter event. But I am curious about what you guys want me to use to avoid something. In normal text RPG, once the event is triggered, you have to go through it, few RPG actually give you a chance to avoid or easily shortcut it if you have sufficient stats to do so. I am curious if you guys want this or even give you chance to avoid some and must go through one depend on if it makes sense such as you can't just say nope, fuck this shit I outta here to enemy ambush unless your stats are that overpower, where on other hand, you can scout enemy force ahead and have chance to leave before walk into them if your Luck or Wisdom or Intelligence is high enough to spot said enemy force.

1, Nah, players go through all events the normal way.

2, players avoid or shortcut events if good enough.

3, players get the choice to avoid or not if good enough regardless if they make sense or not, allowing metagamer or just break the logic of thing to get out or get involved.

4, players get the choice to avoid or not if good enough and it makes sense overall, prevent metagamer.

5, Your choice of thought?

I add a picture of what I have so far, it is still a work in progress before it ready for an alpha release, I reckon a week or two before it ready for an alpha release, altogether that might be meant postpone the save and load system like that are annoying to work within favor of getting server-side over with, people can't really try this out if there no way for they to access it in the first place, so I will need to set up a basic host browser so people can play this from it or convert this into exe for people to download it. I apologized if this screen seems lackluster, this area is where I work on a new feature which is combat and map exploration along with its event trigger. I only came up with this desert-based map and whole of combat and map triggered events several days ago and an allnighter.*/
